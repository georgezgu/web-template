# web-template

My version of my class' starting web template.

### Instructions

**Upon completing a project from this template, please do the following:**

1. Put the files that you would upload to a webserver in this folder. Do not include working files or high PPI images.
2. Remove all template-related information from this readme file. Failure to do so will result in a grade reduction.
3. Add text that describes your project. Include your name, web address, code/image citations, and any notes. 


### About the template

Forked from my professor's original template, web1-basic.

His homepage can be found at the following link:

[Imaginary Terrain](http://imaginaryterrain.com)

The code structure is designed for clarity rather than for browser performance. (Notably, we break CSS out into several files, to help keep code organized.) Even so, the slowdowns will be insignificant for most student/personal sites, and the speed fixes are easy to make.

This project includes elements from HTML5 Boilerplate (see doc/h5bp/ for more).
